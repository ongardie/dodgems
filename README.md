# Dodgems

Dodgems is a simple [snake game] for the [TI-83+] graphing calculator. It was
written in [TI-BASIC] by Diego Ongaro and George Hattemer around 2002. The 8XP
file contains tokenized data as interpreted by the calculator. The
human-readable TXT file was exported using [TI-GRAPH LINK] for Windows.

The version included in this repo is not the latest and greatest version of
Dodgems. The latest known version (and a few others) are stuck on Diego's
calculator. Diego ordered a new link cable in August 2024 to hopefully be able
to extract these files and archive them here.
